# Timothy J. (TJ) Luoma’s Preachers Trust

This is my “Preacher’s Trust” document from Backstory Preaching.

See [BackstoryPreaching.com](https://www.backstorypreaching.com/) and the book [_Backstory Preaching: Integrating Life, Spirituality, and Craft_ by Lisa Cressman](https://smile.amazon.com/Backstory-Preaching-Integrating-Spirituality-Craft-ebook/dp/B07D7VHPNM) for more information.

## Definition of the Preacher’s Trust (from the book)

> The Preacher’s Trust is the preacher’s commitment to abide in Christ in order to be made worthy of the authority granted to preach the Good News.

> The Preacher’s Trust is like the Prayers of the People. There are ten required categories, but the language and choices for each are your own.

> The first five commandments of the Trust cover the backstory of our life and spirituality to “Be Good News,” and the second five integrate them into our craft to “Preach Good News.”

## The Ten Categories

Quoting from Lisa Cressman’s blog post: [“The Preacher’s Trust: A Practice for Becoming a Better Preacher”](https://www.backstorypreaching.com/blog/preachers-trust-practice-become-a-better-preacher) here are the ten categories of a preacher’s trust.

### 1) Pray

Spend time regularly with God apart from the need to pray “for the job” of ministry.

### 2) Read Scripture

Spend time regularly reading, listening to, and asking questions about the Good Book—again, for your own sake, not just because your ministry requires it.

### 3) Cultivate Wonder, Curiosity, Awe, and Gratitude

Discover perpetually God’s endless creativity. Let it spark your imagination and gratitude so you never take God’s gifts for granted.

### 4) Seek Respite in Sermon Prep

Instead of being a box on the checklist, let sermon prep itself feed you spiritually. In that way, sermons are not a chore but a source of perennial joy.

### 5) Trust You’re Loved

We tell parishioners God loves them all the time, and we can cultivate that truth for ourselves, too. When we know God loves us, it spills forth into our entire ministries—and lives. Besides, when we know we’re loved, we know why we preach.

### 6) Craft Effective Sermons

Know what makes for an “effective” sermon and let it serve as the model for every homily.

### 7) Proclaim the Gospel No Matter What

Whether the Good News is well received or not, preachers who practice courage and are ever deepening their relationship with God will preach the Gospel no matter what it costs.

### 8) Preach Ethically

We all know it’s unethical to plagiarize, but there’s more to it than that. We also need to take care not to cherry-pick verses, manipulate emotional heartstrings, or use the pulpit as our personal bully pulpits no matter how much we think we’re justified.

### 9) Keep Learning

In addition to preaching conferences and books, what’s your plan to keep growing and getting better at this craft?

### 10) Be Accountable

Although it may seem we prepare sermons alone, we’re actually part of a body of preachers who are accountable to one another and God to be trustworthy bearers of the Gospel.
