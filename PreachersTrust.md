### 1) Pray

I will spend Monday - Friday from 8:00 a.m. - 9:30 a.m. in prayer, contemplation, and prayerful work: listening to, reading, or writing things to support my life of faith (not be related to sermon preparation).

This may include reading or listening to [The Daily Lectionary](https://thedailylectionary.com) but _may not_ include recording or editing audio for the podcast.

### 2) Engage Scripture

Using something from that time, I will write/journal/sketch/doodle/mindmap whatever has caught my attention that morning. To begin with I plan to use Julia Cameron's [Morning Pages](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/) as my method of engagement, but this may (and possibly _should_) change over time.

### 3) Cultivate Wonder, Curiosity, Awe, and Gratitude

Journal gratitude on a daily basis. Actively seek out new information from the sciences about things we are learning about the universe, the human mind, life, etc. Try to find out things that I didn't even know I didn't know.

### 4) Seek Respite in Sermon Prep


### 5) Trust Youâ€™re Loved


### 6) Craft Effective Sermons


### 7) Proclaim the Gospel No Matter What


### 8) Preach Ethically


### 9) Keep Learning


### 10) Be Accountable
